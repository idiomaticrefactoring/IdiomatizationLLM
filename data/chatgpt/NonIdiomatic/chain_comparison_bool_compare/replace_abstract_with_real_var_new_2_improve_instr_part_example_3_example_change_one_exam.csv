  A legacy evaluation is an evalution that uses only a single EvalSharedModel,
  has no tags (or uses ""eval"" as its tag), and does not specify an eval_config
  The legacy evaluation is based on using add_metrics_callbacks to create a
  modified version of the graph saved with an EvalSavedModel. The newer version
  of evaluation supports both add_metrics_callbacks as well as metrics defined
  in MetricsSpecs inside of EvalConfig. The newer version works with both ""eval""
  and serving models and also supports multi-model evaluation. This function is
  used by code to support backwards compatibility for callers that have not
  updated to use the new EvalConfig.

  Args:
    config_version: Optionally, An explicit version of the config determined
      elsewhere. This is used to handle cases where the provided eval_config was
      generated internally, and thus not a reliable indicator of user intent.
